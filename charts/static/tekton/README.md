# Tekton

There is no official helm chart and I'm too bored to migrate whole chart into golang code.

The urls of the files are:

- pipeline: https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
- triggers/release: https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/release.yaml
- triggers/interceptors: https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/triggers/latest/interceptors.yaml
- dashboard: https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/dashboard/latest/release.yaml
